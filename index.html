                Dub is a genre that originated in Jamaica in the 1960s, and provides a very baseline level of electronic music. With its Jamaican roots it combines a Reggae feel, using xylophones and consistent bass lines to give the listener a very slow and relaxed feel. The deep thrumming bass line is characteristic of this genre, combined with clutural instruments from Jamaica. This genre began to be played at parties and events in Jamaica using mobile DJ setups called sound systems. Full of unconventional sounds, this genre consists of groovy melodies and thick layers of post production editing. Some of the most influential artists in the Dub genre include King Tubby, Augustus Pablo, and Lee "Scratch" Perry.

              <p id="house">Lets start by talking about House Music. This is one of the most widely loved genres of electronic music worldwide. House music originated in the late 1970s and is one of the few genres of electronic music to be authentically American. Its birthplace is none other than Chicago, Illinois. As a spinoff of disco music, house is another genre of electronic music that was created for people to dance to. House is the first direct descendant from disco music after disco rapidly lost its popularity at the end of the decade.</p>

              <p id="techno">Next up is techno. The location of techno music's origin is a contentious topic. Most will agree that it originated in Detroit, Michigan and began gaining notoriety in Chicago and New York. However, because techno's popularity also took off in Germany there are those who say that it originated outside of the United States. Techno is another genre of music that crowds loved to dance to in dance halls. Techno is characterized by machine-like beats and tempos that come across as slightly hypnotic. Techno is a genre that became a global phenomenon and spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe where it remains massively popular to this day. </p>

              <p id="hardstyle"> The next genre of electronic music is hardstyle. Originating in the 1990s, this is a more recent genre of electronic music that took longer to be commercially accepted than others such as house or techno. Written at around 140-150 BPM (very fast), hardstyle is characterized by distorted sounds, synthesizers, and repeated pounding bass combined with percussion. This genre originated in the Netherlands bringing raw energy and intensity to underground rave scenes.

              <p>
                Dubstep began in the early 2000s in London, where the roots of the genre started growing. DJs like Skream, inspired by UK garage and 2-step music, slowed things down a bit, added deep bass, and came up with dubstep. The name hints at its reggae influence, with "dub" in there for the bass-heavy sound. Dubstep was a rebellious move away from the mainstream. In London's underground clubs and pirate radio stations, it caught fire. With its heavy bass, unique rhythm, and moody vibe, dubstep didn't just shake up electronic musicâ€”it left a mark on everything from hip-hop to pop. Dubstep started as an experiment and truly had a groundbreaking impact on the world of electronic music.</p>

              <p>
                In the early 2010s in the Southern United States the beats of Atlanta's hip-hop scene collided with the electronic beats of dance music, giving birth to EDM trap. DJs like RL Grime and Flosstradamus took the rap roots of trap music and injected them into the heart of the EDM scene. The name "trap" nods to "trap houses," where this genre found some of its early inspiration. With its signature heavy bass and snappy hi-hats, EDM trap quickly became the life of the party in clubs everywhere. From the underground scene to the grand stages of festivals, EDM trap's journey is a mix of hip-hop attitude and electronic beats, creating a sound that's gritty and bold.

      <p>For this project I decided to focus on six of the most popular genres. There is a need to focus on a small cluster of genres due to the overwhelming nuance and varied content in the world of electronic music. However, these chosen genres will offer a wider scope on the world of electronic music rather than a narrow one. Almost every genre of electronic music contains subgenres within, meaning these must not be taken at face value. Classification of songs and sounds is meant to keep order and style consistent, but the classification can be loose at times.</p>

      <p> Some key differences between each genre of electronic music are the BPM (Beats per minute), the venue each is played at, and the style of beat that sets the foundation for each other layer of the music. Essentially, the way the beat is constructed and the pace it sets, determines which genre of electronic music it is. This will be elaborated on further into the project.
