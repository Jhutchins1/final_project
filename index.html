            Welcome to the world of electronic music. Electronic music is an term that encompasses many different genres and styles under a broad spectrum. Truly, there is something for everyone in the style of electronic music. 
        </p>

        <p id="second">
            I encourage you to explore the timeline of electronic music, sample each genre, and discover what suits you. Each style of electronic music can suit a different purpose or setting. 
        </p>

        <p>For this project I decided to focus on six of the most popular genres. There is a need to focus on a small cluster of genres due to the overwhelming nuance and varied content in the world of electronic music. However, these chosen genres will offer a wider scope on the world of electronic music rather than a narrow one. Almost every genre of electronic music contains subgenres within, meaning these must not be taken at face value. Classification of songs and sounds is meant to keep order and style consistent, but the classification can be loose at times.</p>

        <p> Some key differences between each genre of electronic music are the BPM (Beats per minute), the venue each is played at, and the style of beat that sets the foundation for each other layer of the music. Essentially, the way the beat is constructed and the pace it sets, determines which genre of electronic music it is. This will be elaborated on further into the project.

        <p id="house">Lets start by talking about House Music. This is one of the most widely loved genres of electronic music worldwide. House music originated in the late 1970s and is one of the few genres of electronic music to be authentically American. Its birthplace is none other than Chicago, Illinois. As a spinoff of disco music, house is another genre of electronic music that was created for people to dance to. House is the first direct descendant from disco music after disco rapidly lost its popularity at the end of the decade.</p>

        <p id="techno">Next up is techno. The location of techno music's origin is a contentious topic. Most will agree that it originated in Detroit, Michigan and began gaining notoriety in Chicago and New York. However, because techno's popularity also took off in Germany there are those who say that it originated outside of the United States.</p>

        <p id="hardstyle"> The next genre of electronic music is hardstyle. Originating in the 1990s, this is a more recent genre of electronic music that took longer to be commercially accepted than others such as house or techno. Written at around 140-150 BPM (very fast), hardstyle is characterized by distorted sounds, synthesizers, and repeated pounding bass combined with percussion.
